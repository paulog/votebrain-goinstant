# VoteBrain

Brainstorm and vote at the same time!

The code for this app comes directly from the goangular wishlist sample app at https://github.com/mattcreager/goangular-wishlist-example

## How to run

1. Create a new app database on goinstant (ex: votebrain)
2. Copy the js/config.example.js to js/config.js.  Replace the goinstant database string with the one for the database you created in step 1.
3. Pull the page up in a couple of browsers.  (Or, use incognito mode.)

## To Do

- The total amount of votes a user can cast should be equal to the number of total items in the list
- Track the votes by user on each idea
- A user can only remove votes they have cast on an idea
- User should be able to see their remaining votes
- Add a countdown timer
- Add styling
